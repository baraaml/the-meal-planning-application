## Project Idea Overview
This application is designed to assist users, especially moms, in planning and organizing meals. Key features include:
1. **Daily-Weekly Meal Planner**: A feature to help plan meals for the week or day.
2. **AI Assistant**: Users can interact with an AI to get meal suggestions based on the day or available ingredients.
3. **Community Space**: A feature for users to share their meals, status updates, and save meal history within their profiles.

## Additional Feature Suggestions
### 1. Recipe Personalization
- Allow users to save preferences, dietary restrictions, or allergies.
- The AI assistant will tailor meal suggestions based on these preferences.

### 2. Shopping List Integration
- Generate a shopping list based on selected meals.
- Helps users keep track of what they need to buy for specific recipes or weekly meal plans.

### 3. Nutritional Information
- Display basic nutritional information (calories, protein, carbs, etc.) for each recipe or meal suggestion.
- Useful for planning balanced meals for families.

### 4. Meal Prep Tips
- Provide suggestions for what can be prepped in advance.
- Offer storage tips for meal components to keep them fresh throughout the week.

### 5. Community Challenges or Themes
- Add themes or challenges (like “Meatless Monday”) for the community to share related meal ideas.
- Encourage users to diversify their meals and engage with others by participating in themed days.

## Next Steps
- **Community Feedback**: Consider creating a Google form for potential users (moms in the area) to gather ideas, pain points, and desired features.
- **User Research**: Use the feedback to prioritize features and better understand the main problems to solve.
